1) Which field of the Customers table is the primary key-
Typically primary key in the table is unique field that identifies each record in the table.
Primary key in the table varies from table to table.
CNUM is primary key for the customers table because each value uniquely identifies each record separately.

mysql> desc CUSTOMERS;  ----> shows  no key hence we can assume the table don't have primary key.
+--------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field  | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+--------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| CNUM   | int         | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| CNAME  | varchar(10) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| CITY   | varchar(10) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| RATING | int         | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| SNUM   | int         | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+--------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
2) What is the 4th column of the Customers table?

mysql> select *from CUSTOMERS LIMIT 1;  or desc CUSTOMERS;
+------+---------+--------+--------+------+
| CNUM | CNAME   | CITY   | RATING | SNUM |
+------+---------+--------+--------+------+
| 2001 | Hoffman | London |    100 | 1001 |
+------+---------+--------+--------+------+
Hence 4 th column in the CUSTOMERS table is SNUM.

3) What is another word for row? For column?
For rows -> It can also be called as records,tuple,entity.
For column -> It can also be called as Fields,attribute or KEY.

4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
when rows are generated they get scattered and fragmented on DB server HD randomly but are accessible sequentially , Hence it is not possible to acess first five or last five rows separately. we can acess rows by using select statement with WHERE CLAUSE.
