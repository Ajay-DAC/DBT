Summarizing Data with Aggregate Functions.
1) Write a query that counts all orders for October 3
mysql> select count(odate) from orders
    -> where odate ='1990-10-03';
+--------------+
| count(odate) |
+--------------+
2) Write a query that counts the number of different non-NULL city values in the 
Customers table
mysql> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM customers;
+----------------------+
| COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) |
+----------------------+
|                    4 |
+----------------------+


3) Write a query that selects each customerâ€™s smallest order
mysql> select customers.cnum, min(orders.Amt) As smallest_order from orders,customers
    -> where orders.cnum = customers.cnum
    -> group by customers.cnum;
+------+----------------+
| cnum | smallest_order |
+------+----------------+
| 2008 |          18.69 |
| 2001 |         767.19 |
| 2007 |        1900.10 |

| 2004 |          75.75 |
| 2006 |        4723.00 |
+------+----------------+
customers -> driving table, orders -> driven table.

4) Write a query that selects the first customer, in alphabetical order, whose name 
begins with G

mysql> select * from customers
    -> where CNAME like 'G%';
+------+----------+--------+--------+------+
| CNUM | CNAME    | CITY   | RATING | SNUM |
+------+----------+--------+--------+------+
| 2002 | Givoanni | Rome   |    200 | 1003 |
| 2004 | Grass    | Berlin |    300 | 1002 |
+------+----------+--------+--------+------+

5) Write a query that selects the highest rating in each city.
mysql> select CITY,MAX(RATING) from customers
    -> group by CITY;     //city ->non aggregate column, MAX ->aggreagate fn. 
                          // without Group by SQL dont understand  the aggreagate with non 
                           // aggregate column hence use group by.                 
+----------+-------------+
| CITY     | MAX(RATING) |
+----------+-------------+
| London   |         100 |
| Rome     |         200 |
| San Jose |         300 |
| Berlin   |         300 |
+----------+-------------+

6) Write a query that counts the number of salespeople registering orders for each 
day. (If a salesperson has more than one order on a given day, he or she should be 
counted only once.)
HINT 
mysql> select salespeople.snum, orders.snum, count(distinct(orders.snum)) from orders , salespeople
    -> where orders.snum = salespeople.snum
    -> group by salespeople.snum;
+------+------+------------------------------+
| snum | snum | count(distinct(orders.snum)) |
+------+------+------------------------------+
| 1001 | 1001 |                            1 |
| 1002 | 1002 |                            1 |
| 1003 | 1003 |                            1 |
| 1007 | 1007 |                            1 |
